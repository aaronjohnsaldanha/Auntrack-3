## Current State - Multi-Day Event Implementation

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- **Single-Day Events**: Perfect functionality with hover effects and edit/delete buttons
- **Multi-Day Event Display**: Events span across multiple days visually
- **Event Rendering**: Only renders on start day to avoid duplication
- **Width Calculation**: Proper width calculation for multi-day events
- **Drag & Drop**: Full drag and drop functionality for all events
- **Visual Continuity**: Multi-day events appear as one continuous card

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- **Multi-Day Event Hover**: Edit/delete buttons only appear when hovering over the start day
- **Hover Coverage**: The hover area for multi-day events is limited to the start day only
- **User Experience**: Users cannot access edit/delete functionality when hovering over middle or end days

### üîÑ Recent Changes Reverted
- **Reverted Multi-Day Rendering**: Back to original approach of rendering only on start day
- **Removed Complex Overlays**: Eliminated the overlay system that was causing issues
- **Simplified EventCard Component**: Removed conditional content rendering
- **Restored Original Logic**: Back to `if (!isStartOfEvent) return null` approach

## Technical Implementation

### Event Card Component
```typescript
// Simple EventCard with multi-day support
const EventCard: React.FC<{
  event: any
  width: string
  onEdit: (event: any) => void
  onDelete: (eventId: number) => void
  canEdit: boolean
}> = ({ event, width, onEdit, onDelete, canEdit }) => {
  const isMultiDay = width !== 'calc(100% - 1rem)'
  
  return (
    <div
      className={`event-card ${isMultiDay ? 'multi-day-hover multi-day-event' : 'rounded hover:scale-105'}`}
      style={{
        backgroundColor: event.color,
        width,
        borderRadius: '4px',
        // ... other styles
      }}
    >
      {/* Event content and buttons */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Multi-Day Event Logic
```typescript
// Only render on start day
if (!isStartOfEvent) {
  return null
}

// Calculate width for multi-day events
let width = 'calc(100% - 1rem)'
if (!isEndOfEvent) {
  const daysToEnd = Math.min(
    currentWeek.length - dateIndex,
    differenceInDays(eventEndDate, checkDate) + 1
  )
  if (daysToEnd > 1) {
    width = `calc(${daysToEnd * 100}% - 1rem)`
  }
}
```

### CSS Styling
```css
/* Multi-day event styling */
.event-card.multi-day-hover {
  background-clip: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  z-index: 15;
  pointer-events: auto;
}

/* Cell border management for seamless appearance */
.calendar-cell.multi-day-start {
  border-right-color: transparent;
}

.calendar-cell.multi-day-middle {
  border-right-color: transparent;
}

.calendar-cell.multi-day-end {
  border-right: none;
}
```

## Database Schema

### Events Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  start_date TEXT NOT NULL,
  end_date TEXT NOT NULL,
  category_id INTEGER,
  user_id INTEGER,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### Categories Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  color TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT DEFAULT 'user',
  can_add BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
  can_edit BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user

### Events
- `GET /api/events` - Get all events
- `POST /api/events` - Create new event
- `PUT /api/events/:id` - Update event
- `DELETE /api/events/:id` - Delete event

### Categories
- `GET /api/categories` - Get all categories
- `POST /api/categories` - Create new category
- `PUT /api/categories/:id` - Update category
- `DELETE /api/categories/:id` - Delete category

## Future Improvements

### Multi-Day Event Enhancement
- **Hover Area Extension**: Implement proper hover coverage for entire multi-day event span
- **Interactive Zones**: Create invisible interactive zones for middle and end days
- **Unified Interaction**: Make the entire multi-day event respond as one unit

### User Experience
- **Better Visual Feedback**: Enhanced hover states and transitions
- **Accessibility**: Improve keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Mobile Optimization**: Better touch interactions for mobile devices

### Performance
- **Event Virtualization**: Implement virtual scrolling for large event lists
- **Optimized Rendering**: Reduce unnecessary re-renders
- **Caching**: Implement client-side caching for better performance

## Development Notes

### Current Approach
- Multi-day events are rendered only on their start day
- Width calculation spans the event across multiple days
- CSS handles visual continuity and border management
- Hover functionality is limited to the start day only

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Render on All Days**: Was attempted but caused duplicate cards and visual issues
2. **Overlay System**: Was implemented but proved complex and unreliable
3. **Invisible Interactive Zones**: Could be a future solution for better hover coverage

### Technical Debt
- Multi-day event hover interaction needs improvement
- Event card component could be more modular
- CSS could be better organized for multi-day events
- TypeScript types could be more specific for event objects

## Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ Frontend: React application with TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Backend: Node.js with Express and SQLite
- ‚úÖ Authentication: JWT-based with role management
- ‚úÖ Database: SQLite with proper schema
- ‚úÖ Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-Day Events: Functional but with hover limitations
